//javaScript operators are symbols which are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operation and more
// >> the variable (operation) are called operands.
// >> The operation (to be performed between the two operands) are defined by an operator

// OPERATORS

// ARITHMETIC OPERATORS ARE;

// Addition(+)

//Eg

let a =5;
let b = 7;
let c = a + b;
// Subtraction(-)
// Multiplcation(*)
// Division(/)
// Modulus or remainder(%)
// Increment(+)
// Decrement (-)

// COMPARISION
// Used to compare two different variables

// Examples
// == (Equal to)
// === (Equal value and equal type)
// != (Not equal to)
// !== (not equal value and not equal type) 
// < Less than
// > greater than
// >=  Greater than or equal to
// <= Less tha or equal to

// LOGICAL or RATIONAL OPERATOR
// Use comparision operator to find certain results either TRUEor FALSE.

// ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 

// Examples

// Assign the value 10 to x, and 2 to y

let x=10;
let y=2;
let answer=12;
let z=x+y;
console.log(answer)
// CONDITIONAL or TERNARY OPERATORS
// Assigns a value to a variable based on some condition

// STRING OPERATORS
// The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings

// TYPE OPERATORS
// Used to determine the type ofdata stored in a variable.

// BITWISE OPERATOR
