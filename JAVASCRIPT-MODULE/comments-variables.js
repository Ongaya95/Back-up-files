// VARIABLES

// declaring variables for the firstName
let firstName = "Geoffrey"

// outputting variables onto the cconsole 


// variables are containers for storing values.
// variables must be identified with unigue names.
// variables can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, total volume)


// The general rules for constructing names for variables (unigue identifiers) are;
// Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar sign
// Names must begin with a letter.
// Names can also begin with $ and _
// Names can be case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
// Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) can not be used as names.
// Use meaningful names
// Use camel casing
// Variables are case sensitive
// Var used in earlier versions though still works but now use let
// All numbers can never be put in quotes or else it will be considered a string.
// syntax -

// Examples
// reserved key words like let, const, var, false, true, if 

let student;//declaration
student ="Ongaya" //initialisation.  It is giving value to variable.
